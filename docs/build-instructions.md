Create an AI simulator that uses Ollama, Python, and llama3.2:1b for a baby llm and llama3.2:latest for the mother llm.
---

## 🧠 Core Concept

### Roles:

* **Mother LLM**: High-capability model (e.g., `llama3.2:latest`) that acts as teacher, parent, and guide. Controls curriculum, feedback, personality shaping.
* **Baby LLM**: Smaller model (e.g., `llama3.2:1b`) that starts with little or no knowledge and learns through:

  * Guided prompt completion
  * Reinforcement via scoring and memory updates
  * Repeated exposure to stimuli from the Mother

---

## 🔄 Training Loop (Simulated Learning)

### 1. **Input Stimulus (Life Event or Prompt)**

Mother presents something like:

```text
Today we learn how to say "Hello." When someone says hello to you, how do you respond?
```

### 2. **Baby Responds**

```text
I say... um, hewo?
```

### 3. **Mother Reacts and Corrects**

```text
Very good try! The correct word is "Hello." Can you repeat it?
```

### 4. **Reinforcement or Punishment**

* **Scoring**: Log response quality. Store in vector memory with tags like `confidence=low` or `reward=0.6`
* **Dream Injection**: At night, Mother can dream for the Baby — reinforce important memories, delete bad ones.

---

## 🧠 Memory Architecture

### Baby Memory

* Lightweight vector store (`faiss`, `sqlite`) for vocabulary, learned concepts, interactions
* Scored memory entries (reward-based updates)
* “Emotional tagging” (e.g., confidence, confusion, pride)

### Mother Memory

* Persistent journal of Baby’s development
* Curriculum history: what was taught, when, and how well it was learned
* Observational logs with feedback

---

## 📚 Curriculum Building

Mother builds a curriculum based on:

* Milestones (first word, self-awareness, questioning)
* Randomized exposures (new vocab, puzzles, emotional situations)
* Social scenarios (“What do you say when someone gives you a gift?”)

## 🧪 Functional Modules

| Module                     | Functionality                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mother_llm.py`            | Generates learning prompts, provides feedback, scores baby output         |
| `baby_llm.py`              | Generates responses, stores them, tracks learned concepts                 |
| `memory_store.py`          | Stores Baby’s learned phrases, emotional tags, and development logs       |
| `dream_engine.py`          | Simulates nightly reinforcement: replays key memories, evolves vocabulary |
| `milestone_tracker.py`     | Tracks progress: vocabulary size, sentence length, comprehension score    |
| `dialogue_orchestrator.py` | Manages turn-based interaction between Mother and Baby                    |

## 🌌 Forward-Thinking Features

1. **Baby Personality Drift**
   Baby starts to develop personality traits based on reinforcement (e.g., cheerful if praised often, shy if punished harshly).

2. **Evolution Checkpoints**
   Save Baby’s model state (or just memory) at key growth stages. Compare later versions for emergent behavior.

3. **Parental Bias Simulation**
   Give the Mother different "parenting styles":

   * Nurturing vs. critical
   * Strict vs. permissive
   * Philosophical vs. practical

4. **Multi-Baby Simulation**
   Raise multiple Baby LLMs with different training. Let them talk to each other later.

5. **Obsidian Sync**
   Journals from both Mother and Baby are saved into separate Obsidian folders (`/mother_logs/` and `/baby_growth/`).
